##Prerequisites

The project has one HTML, one JS and three HTML (depending on screen size of a user) files. The game is running online and there is no need to install any software on a PC except for standard Java Script and a broweser. 

## Instructions

At the beginning there are 16 closed cards on board and the goal is to find a pair for each 8 ones. The game starts if a user clicks any card on board and ends when all card are matched. Only two cards could be opened at one time. If they don't match they will close in 300 milliseconds. The developer concideres this time as enough to memorize the cards. A user has any quntity of moves and time he/she needs. The moves are counted and the timer starts to run after the first move though. The timer is coded only for minutes and seconds. Hours will not be counted as the developer is sure: under one hour time is totally enough for finishing one game. If the game is running more then hour timer will be started from the beginning exactly after one hour. After each 20 moves a user lose one star of three untill only one star is left.

After having finished a game a user sees a score board with a button for a new game.

The interface of the game is optimized for a creen under 500px width, under 700px width and the rest. 

##Repeat

The game could be repeated only with initiating of a user any time by clicking 'refresh page' or 'restart' symbol on the score panel. After have succesfully finished the game a user has an opportunity to start over with the button 'play again' on the score board.
